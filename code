Step 1: Data Collection

To crawl social media platforms, we'll use the Tweepy library to access Twitter data. Ensure you have installed the Tweepy library using pip install tweepy. Here's an example of collecting tweets related to HP printers:

import tweepy

# Set up your Twitter API credentials
consumer_key = "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY"
consumer_secret = "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET"
access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
access_token_secret = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"

# Authenticate and create the API object
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth)

# Search for tweets mentioning HP printers
search_query = "HP printer"
tweet_limit = 1000  # Adjust as per your needs

tweets = []
for tweet in tweepy.Cursor(api.search, q=search_query, lang="en").items(tweet_limit):
    tweets.append(tweet.text)

# Print the collected tweets
for tweet in tweets:
    print(tweet)


Step 2: Text Classification

For text classification, we'll use a pre-trained model such as a BERT-based model and fine-tune it on your specific dataset. The Hugging Face library provides easy-to-use interfaces for working with pre-trained models. Here's an example using the transformers library:

from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=3)  # 3 labels: complaint, suggestion, appreciation

# Tokenize and classify the tweets
encoded_inputs = tokenizer(tweets, padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=128, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**encoded_inputs)
predicted_labels = outputs.logits.argmax(dim=1)

# Print the predicted labels
for i, tweet in enumerate(tweets):
    print(f"Tweet: {tweet}")
    print(f"Predicted Label: {predicted_labels[i]}")


Step 3: Knowledge Graph Construction

To construct the knowledge graph, we'll use a graph database like Neo4j. Ensure you have installed Neo4j and the neo4j Python library using pip install neo4j. Here's an example of creating nodes and relationships in the knowledge graph:



from neo4j import GraphDatabase

# Set up Neo4j connection
uri = "bolt://localhost:7687"  # Replace with your Neo4j database URI
username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"

# Connect to the Neo4j database
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(username, password))

# Create a node for each tweet
with driver.session() as session:
    for i, tweet in enumerate(tweets):
        session.run("CREATE (t:Tweet {id: $id, text: $text})", id=i, text=tweet)

# Create relationships between tweets and their labels
with driver.session() as session:
    for i, label in enumerate(predicted_labels):
        session.run("MATCH (t:Tweet {id: $id}), (l:Label {name: $label}) CREATE (t)-[:HAS_LABEL]->(l)",
                    id=i, label=label_names[label])


Step 4: Querying and Visualization

To query the knowledge graph, you can use the Cypher query language supported by Neo4j. Here's an example of querying for tweets mentioning a specific problem:


# Query tweets mentioning a specific problem
problem = "wifi issue"
query = "MATCH (t:Tweet)-[:HAS_LABEL]->(:Label {name: 'complaint'}) WHERE t.text CONTAINS $problem RETURN t.text"

with driver.session() as session:
    result = session.run(query, problem=problem)
    for record in result:
        print(record["t.text"])


Step 5: Continuous Improvement

To continuously improve the solution, you can periodically retrain the text classification model with new data, update the knowledge graph with new tweets and sentiments, and analyze the graph to identify patterns and trends.

Please note that the code snippets provided are just examples to illustrate the solution and may require further customization based on your specific needs, such as data preprocessing, model training, and database schema design.
